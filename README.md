# Blog-Page-Using-React
This is a blog post using react and app write.


## Day 1
App write is Back-end As a Services. Tiny MCE is reach text editor.
As we are saving blog text content in HTML which can not be render directly, so we will parse it using react parser.
We will use react forms.

In production, as react is a front end framework, and it will display all the text to browser, therefore there are few variables are created as a system variables which are only for system and not for UI or users.
Such variables are writen in .env files, which are must be created inside the root of the project.
.env file will not be uploaded to github or any open source platform.
